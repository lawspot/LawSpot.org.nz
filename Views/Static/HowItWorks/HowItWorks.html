<h1>How Does LawSpot Work?</h1>
            
<p>LawSpot is a website where members of the public, like you, can ask questions about New Zealand law and qualified lawyer volunteers will answer them for free. The awesome people at Community Law Wellington & Hutt Valley will check the answers before they're published online for you to browse.</p>
