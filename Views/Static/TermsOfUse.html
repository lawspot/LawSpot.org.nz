<h1>Terms of Use</h1>

<h2>QUESTIONS LAWSPOT DOESN'T ANSWER</h2>

<p>LawSpot does not answer questions about conveyancing or property leasing (except residential tenancies), or questions from landlords, or from business ventures and employers. This is because LawSpot is aimed at addressing unmet legal need in the community.</p>

<p>LawSpot will only provide very basic information in relation to questions about wills, estates, property relationship agreements, powers of attorney and enduring powers of attorney. This is because LawSpot cannot assist with reviewing or drafting any documents in these areas due to the online Q&amp;A format.</p>

<h2>INFORMATION YOU NEED TO READ FIRST</h2>

<p>The Rules of Conduct and Client Care for Lawyers of the New Zealand Law Society require that we provide you in advance with the following initial information:</p>

<h3>Professional indemnity insurance</h3>

<p>The answers published on LawSpot are provided by different legal organisations or individual lawyers. Organisations that provide answers on the LawSpot website may include Community Law Wellington and Hutt Valley (CLWHV), partner law firms or partner lawyers with independent practicing certificates.</p>

<p>Each LawSpot answer indicates which organisation or individual has provided the answer. LawSpot is covered by the professional indemnity insurance held by the organisation or individual that has provided the answer. The indemnity insurance held by these organisations or individuals meets or exceeds the minimum standards specified by the Law Society. We will provide you with the particulars of the minimum standards upon request.</p>

<h3>Lawyers’ Fidelity Fund</h3>

<p>The Law Society maintains the Lawyers’ Fidelity Fund for the purposes of providing clients of lawyers with protection against pecuniary loss arising from theft by lawyers. As the legal services we provide are free and we do not receive or hold money or valuables on trust, the fidelity fund is not relevant to the services offered by LawSpot.</p>

<h3>Complaints procedure</h3>

<p>We maintain a procedure for handling any complaints by users of the LawSpot website (the Website). The procedure is designed to ensure that a complaint is dealt with promptly and fairly. See below for more information about LawSpot’s Complaints Procedure.</p>

<p>If you have tried using LawSpot’s Complaints Procedure and it has proven unsatisfactory, you can also make a complaint to the Law Society’s Lawyers Complaints Service by phoning 0800 261 801, emailing complaints@lawsociety.org.nz, or writing to PO Box 494, Wellington 6140. More information about the Lawyers Complaints Service can be found at <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/home/for_lawyers/regulatory/complaints">http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/home/for_lawyers/regulatory/complaints</a>.</p>

<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

<h3>No liability</h3>

<p>
    While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the contents of this website, no
    liability whatsoever is accepted by the authors or publishers, for loss, damage or
    inconvenience consequent upon any error or omission, or arising in any way from the use of this
    site. LawSpot endeavours to provide a service of the highest quality. However, we cannot
    guarantee that our service will be uninterrupted or error-free.
</p>

<h3>Not intended to be comprehensive</h3>

<p>
    The Website is intended as a forum where users can post general questions
    about New Zealand law and have their questions answered online by qualified lawyers. It is
    intended for general informational purposes and as a first port of call only and is not
    intended to be comprehensive.
</p>

<h3>Not a substitute for face-to-face legal advice</h3>

<p>
    The answers published on the Website cannot be considered a substitute for face-to-face legal advice.
    If you have a particularly complex or specific question, you should seek personal legal advice. You
    can talk to your local Community Law Centre about advice options. You should never rely on the
    information provided in our answers as the sole basis for taking action in relation to a legal issue.
    This <a href="/important-notice">IMPORTANT NOTICE</a> is included as part of every answer published on
    the Website, as a reminder to users of the limitations of the answer.
</p>

<h3>LawSpot may refuse to answer your question</h3>

<p>
    LawSpot also reserves the right to refuse to answer a question if a LawSpot administrator
    considers that the question:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>has already been asked and answered on the Website;</li>
    <li>contains objectionable or offensive material;</li>
    <li>is too complex or specific in nature;</li>
    <li>contains information that would place any person at risk of being personally identified;</li>
    <li>relates to an area of law that LawSpot doesn’t cover: LawSpot does not answer questions about conveyancing or property leasing (except residential tenancies), or questions from landlords, or from business ventures and employers;</li>
    <li>may itself be in breach of New Zealand law - including the laws of contempt, breach of confidence,
    breach of privacy, and defamation;</li>
    <li>or for any other reason.</li>
</ul>

<h3>LawSpot may modify your question</h3>

<p>
    LawSpot also reserves the right to modify (through its administrators) any question that might
    otherwise be rejected for any of the above reasons so that it can be made available for lawyers
    to answer.
</p>

<h3>Time it takes to answer a question</h3>

<p>
    LawSpot will endeavour to answer the user’s question as soon as possible. However, as LawSpot is in the
    early stages of its development, users’ questions may take several weeks or months to be answered. We would
    be grateful for your patience. If your question is urgent, we encourage you to contact your local Community
    Law Centre to find out about options for face-to-face advice.
</p>

<h3>You consent to LawSpot answering questions from the “other side”</h3>

<p>
    When you submit a question on the Website, you will be asked to tick a box that asks if you
    agree to the Website’s Terms of Use and checks that you understand that your question and the answer
    will be made public (but your name won’t be). By ticking this box, you indicate that you understand that
    LawSpot’s lawyer volunteers may also respond to questions submitted by someone who may be the
    other party to your legal issue, and you consent to this. You are aware that a LawSpot lawyer
    may, in the course of answering the other party’s question, provide material that could have
    negative implications for your own legal position. 
</p>

<h3>Sometimes LawSpot lawyers may already be acting for the “other side”</h3>

<p>
    When you submit a question and accept these Terms of Use, you also indicate that you accept that a LawSpot lawyer volunteer, the CLWHV, or the employer firm of a LawSpot volunteer (“LawSpot and its associated entities”) may advise the other party to your legal issue. You understand that LawSpot and its associated entities may, in the course of advising another client, provide advice to that other client that could have negative implications for your own legal position, and you consent to this. Because all questions are anonymised when they are submitted on the Website, LawSpot lawyer volunteers will not know whether you are in dispute with another client of LawSpot or its associated entities. 
</p>

<h3>You consent to only certain information being disclosed to you</h3>

<p>
    When you submit a question and accept these Terms of Use, you also indicate that you understand that each LawSpot lawyeris only obliged to tell you information about the relevant area of law as at the time they answer your question, and to tell you if they are aware of other questions received or answers published by LawSpot that are relevant to your question, and you consent to this. No LawSpot lawyer is obliged to tell you any new information they come across that may be relevant to your question that the lawyer has become aware of after the answer to your question has been published. This means you will not receive any new information whether held by LawSpot, the CLWHV, the LawSpot lawyer volunteers personally, or by any employer of a LawSpot lawyer volunteer. 
</p>

<p>
    You are aware that this means that if a LawSpot lawyer, after answering your question, becomes
    aware of information that could assist you in dealing with your particular legal issue, that
    lawyer does not have to share with you that further information, even if this non-disclosure
    could have negative implications for your own legal position. 
</p>

<h3>Lawyers’ obligation to exercise independent judgment</h3>

<p>
    None of these terms affect the obligation that applies to all lawyers, to exercise independent
    judgment when answering questions and to give objective advice based on the lawyer’s
    understanding of the law. 
</p>

<h3>Alternatives are available</h3>

<p>
    You are aware that there are alternatives to consenting to these terms. For example, you could
    seek face-to-face advice at a local Community Law Centre, or retain a lawyer to advise you. 
</p>
