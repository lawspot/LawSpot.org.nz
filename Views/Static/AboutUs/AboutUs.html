<h1>About LawSpot</h1>
            
<p>
    LawSpot is a free online legal Q&A service.
</p>

<p>
    Our purpose is to make the law more accessible to all New Zealanders. We do this by getting
    you, the user, to post up your question about New Zealand law on our website. A lawyer
    volunteer will then answer your question, free of charge, and LawSpot publishes the answer in
    a searchable Q&A database - how’s that for accessible?
</p>

<p>
    But it’s early days yet…LawSpot is currently being piloted in the Wellington region. This means
    that all questions will be answered by Wellington lawyers, under the supervision of the
    Community Law Wellington & Hutt Valley. Of course, because it’s online you can submit a question from
    anywhere, but it will be another couple of months before we bring on board lawyers from other
    regions. We’d still love to hear from anyone interested in being involved, so contact
    <a href="&#109;ailto&#58;recruitment&#64;lawspot.org.nz">recruitment&#64;lawspot.org.nz</a>
    if you want to know more about joining the LawSpot team.

        technology to increase access to the law. Maya is very fond of, but highly allergic to,
        cats.
