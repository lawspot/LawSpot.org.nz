    LawSpot is a free online legal service. If you are a New Zealander with a legal problem or a
    question about New Zealand law, we are your first port of call!
</p>

<p>
    First, we assess your question. If your question is generic and within our

    be published anonymously on our website to help out others with the same problem in future.
</p>

<p>
    If it is a specific question, or requires further detailed legal advice, or is otherwise
    outside our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, we will send you an email with a list of our
    trusted law firms that you can contact directly about the problem.

        anything caffeinated.
