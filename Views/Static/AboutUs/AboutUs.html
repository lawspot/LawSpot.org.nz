<h1>About LawSpot</h1>
            
<p>
    LawSpot is a free online legal Q&A service.
</p>

<p>
    Our purpose is to make the law more accessible to all New Zealanders. We do this by getting
    you, the user, to post up your question about New Zealand law on our website. A lawyer
    volunteer will then answer your question, free of charge, and LawSpot publishes the answer in
    a searchable Q&A database - how’s that for accessible?
</p>

<p>
    But it’s early days yet…LawSpot is currently being piloted in the Wellington region. This means
    that all questions will be answered by Wellington lawyers, under the supervision of the
    Wellington Community Law Centre. Of course, because it’s online you can submit a question from
    anywhere, but it will be another couple of months before we bring on board lawyers from other
    regions. We’d still love to hear from anyone interested in being involved, so contact
    <a href="&#109;ailto&#58;recruitment&#64;lawspot.org.nz">recruitment&#64;lawspot.org.nz</a>
    if you want to know more about joining the LawSpot team.

	<h2>Management Team</h2>
	            
	<h3>Maya Shino <em>CEO</em></h3>
	<p>
        Co-founder Maya is a solicitor by day, and the CEO of LawSpot by, er, later in the day.
        Maya works at Russell McVeagh, a top-tier corporate law firm. She is passionate about using
        technology to increase access to the law. Maya is very fond of, but highly allergic to,
        cats.

	<h3>Bowen Pan <em>Co-Founder</em></h3>
	<p>
        Co-founder Bowen is a serial technology entrepreneur (no, it’s not some kind of breakfast
        food). He is also the former head of Treat Me product and marketing at Trade Me. Bowen is
        about to embark upon a MBA at Stanford University. He likes karaoke – a little too much,
        some would say.
    </p>
     
	<h3>Elizabeth Chan <em>Head of Partnerships</em></h3>
	<p>
        Lizzie is perfect for the Head of Partnerships role, as she has several years of experience
        working closely with student and community organisations. She gets her energy from a
        serious addiction to chocolate, and from her passion for empowering people to help
        themselves. Lizzie is a judge’s clerk at the Supreme Court and the current National
        President of UN Youth New Zealand.

	<h3>Paul Bartrum <em>Head of Technology</em></h3>
	<p>
        Paul is LawSpot’s web developer ninja. He works in the Development Team at Trade Me, and
        recently helped set up the Treat Me daily deals site and the Treat Me Now mobile app. Paul
        eats dessert first. And second. And third. He has a thing for jaffa cakes (don’t ask).
    </p>
	            
	<h3>Cheryl Sun <em>Head of Product</em></h3>
	<p>
        Cheryl is a web designer and developer. And a lawyer too! She is currently studying towards
        a Masters in Law from the University of Edinburgh. As LawSpot’s Head of Product, Cheryl is
        responsible for keeping the site looking super swish and easy to use. You wouldn’t pick it,
        but Cheryl is also a World of Warcraft enthusiast and cannot wait for Diablo 3.
    </p>

    <h3>James Whitaker <em>Head of Marketing</em></h3>
	<p>
        James is the voice of LawSpot. He manages all of LawSpot’s marketing and social media.
        James is the current Marketing Manager at Trade Me (noticing a theme here?) Previously, he
        was a Marketing Manager for the New Zealand Police, heading the “Get better work stories”
        recruitment campaign. Outside of work, James enjoys surfing, fishing and spending time with
        his three daughters.
