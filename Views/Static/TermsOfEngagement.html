<h1>Pro Bono Terms of Engagement</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
<li>LawSpot is a non-profit, Q&A website that contains information relating to New Zealand law. 
<li>The Wellington Community Law Centre (WCLC) is a cornerstone partner of LawSpot, and legally qualified WCLC supervisors screen all answers provided by Members before they are published online. 
<li>The purpose of LawSpot is to increase New Zealanders’ access to the law.
</ol>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>In order to register to answer questions on LawSpot, you must select the tick-box labelled “I agree to the LawSpot Pro Bono Terms of Engagement”. By selecting this tick-box, you indicate that you accept the terms of this agreement as well as the terms contained in the Website’s <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not accept any terms contained in any of these agreements, you should not select this tick-box and you will not be able to register to become a LawSpot Member.

<h2>Parties</h2>
<p>This agreement contains all the primary terms between a lawyer who has been approved a registered LawSpot volunteer (“you” or “Member”) and LawSpot (together, “the Parties”). The agreement is to be read in conjunction with the Website’s <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.

<h2>Commencement</h2>
<p>The relationship arising from this agreement commences from the time you receive an email notification from LawSpot confirming that you are now an approved LawSpot Member.

<h2>Requirements for approval</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
<li>You must be enrolled as a barrister and solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand and hold a current practising certificate in order to become a registered LawSpot Member and answer questions on the Website. 
<li>LawSpot will use the information you provide upon registration (your name, the year you were admitted to the Bar, and the name of your employer) to verify that you hold a current practising certificate.
<li>Before you are approved as a Member and able to answer questions on the Website, LawSpot may require you to undertake some initial training in relation to the use of the Website and to go over LawSpot’s policies on answering questions. This training will be coordinated by LawSpot and may take place online or in a face-to-face training session. It will be conducted over a session of no more than 2 hours in duration. LawSpot will email you further information about the next training session once you have submitted your online registration form.
<li>LawSpot reserves the right to refuse to register any person as a LawSpot Member, if this is, in LawSpot’s opinion, necessary to protect the LawSpot service or to further the objectives of the Website.
</ol>

<h2>Email notifications</h2>
<p>You will receive the following email notifications from LawSpot as part of the registration process:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
<li>An email notifying you that LawSpot has received your registration form and will be in touch once your details have been verified; and
<li>An email notifying you that:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>your details have been verified and that you will be able to begin answering questions on LawSpot once you have completed the requisite training specified above at 5(c) above; or
<li>your registration has been rejected as the information you have provided does not match the details of any currently enrolled barrister and solicitor of the High Court, or because LawSpot has exercised its right to refuse your registration in the interests of protecting the LawSpot service.
</ol>
</ol>

<h2>Answering questions – scope of Member’s responsibilities</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
<li>You agree that you answer any questions on the Website for free, on a pro bono basis. Pro bono work, for the purposes of this agreement, is defined as work done in a manner without fee. 
<li>When answering questions on the Website, you agree to adhere to LawSpot’s policies on answering, as outlined to you in the initial training session referred to at 5(c) above.
<li>You agree to take care to provide only general information and assistance in response to questions on the Website (for example, outlining in general the state of the law in that particular area, or directing the user to a relevant piece of legislation or case).
<li>You agree to take caution in providing answers, such as by explaining what additional facts might be needed before the question can be fully answered, and making any necessary caveats (such as pointing out that the legal issue in question is currently subject to litigation or is pending judgment by a court).
</ol>

<h2>Conflict of interest</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
<li>LawSpot has taken reasonable steps to prevent situations where a conflict of interest may arise between the user who submits a question on the Website, and the Member who contributes to the answer to that question. 
<li>LawSpot’s administrators remove all content of a question that has the potential to identify the user who has submitted it. Members will only be able to view questions after they have been vetted by administrators in this way, to ensure that user anonymity is protected to prevent Members from being conflicted out of answering some users’ questions.
<li>However, despite the reasonable precautions taken by LawSpot and although a question has been properly vetted by administrators to remove identifying material, there may be situations where a Member may, in light of the content, topic or timing of a particular question, suspect a particular individual to be behind that question. If, as a Member, you form this view in relation to a particular question, you agree that you will not provide an answer to that particular question if doing so could give rise to a conflict of interest between you and the user you suspect to be behind the question. 
<li>LawSpot reserves the right to terminate this agreement immediately if in its opinion a conflict of interest arises, either between a Member and a user of the Website, or between the work of the Member and the work of LawSpot. Termination must be conveyed to the Member in writing, including by email.
</ol>

<h2>Supervision by the Wellington Community Law Centre</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
<li>Your question will be screened by a legally qualified Wellington Community Law Centre (WCLC) supervisor before it is published online. 
<li>The WCLC reserves the right to modify or rewrite your answer, or to reject it outright. 
<li>Once approved, the answer will be published under the name of the WCLC. You will not be personally identified as the lawyer who contributed to the answer.
</ol>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
<li>Only LawSpot’s administrators will be able to view the personal information you provide us with when you register. LawSpot’s administrators must treat this information as confidential and can only use it for the limited purposes set out in the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
<li>LawSpot will not publish the identity of a Member on the Website. Your identity is protected, and the fact that you have registered to answer questions on the Website is confidential as between LawSpot and you.
<li>By answering questions on the Website, you accept that some or all of your answer (depending on whether the WCLC has modified it) will be published on the Website and available for public view. Accordingly, you waive any rights to claim confidentiality over the content of the answer you submit.
<li>The <a href="/important-notice">IMPORTANT NOTICE</a> attached to every answer makes clear that no liability whatsoever is accepted by the authors or the publishers, for loss, damage or inconvenience consequent upon the question or answer being made public. 
<li>As outlined at 9(b) above, because all answers are posted under the name of the WCLC, you will not be personally identified as the lawyer who contributed to a particular answer.
</ol>

<h2>Disclaimer of liability</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
<li>LawSpot has taken reasonable steps to protect you as a Member from being exposed to liability through your use of the Website. 
<li>Every registered LawSpot Member is protected from liability for their actions in relation to their use of the Website through an indemnity offered by the Wellington Community Law Centre (WCLC). This indemnity is the same in scope as that offered by the WCLC to lawyer volunteers who assist in the centre’s provision of community legal services. Furthermore, as each answer is published under the name of the WCLC, you will not be personally liable for the content of the answer, nor identified as a contributor to that answer.
<li>This IMPORTANT NOTICE will appear as part of every answer published, to make clear to the user the fact that the answer provided is not a substitute for personal legal advice and that no liability whatsoever is accepted by the authors or publishers of the answer, for loss, damage or inconvenience arising in any way from the use of the Website.
