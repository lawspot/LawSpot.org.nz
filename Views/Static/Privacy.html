<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
    Protecting your privacy matters to us. This document discloses our information gathering and
    usage practices in relation to the LawSpot website (the Website). For additional information
    about the Website please review our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>. We reserve the right to
    change our privacy policy from time to time but will notify our users about any such changes on
    the Website.
</p>

<h2>Use of your information</h2>

<p>
    We collect personal information about you through your use of the Website, including your
    registration details and information relating to your use of the Website and the content you
    access.
</p>

<p>
    We may use this personal information to help us provide LawSpot services to you, to verify your
    identity, to enforce or apply our terms and conditions, to protect the rights, property, or
    safety of LawSpot, our users, or others, for internal or government agency research purposes,
    for promoting other LawSpot services to you, and for any other use that you authorise.
</p>

<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.</p>

<p>
    We release account and other personal information only when we believe release is appropriate
    for legal compliance and law enforcement (including to government agencies with statutory law
    enforcement responsibilities); to facilitate court proceedings; enforce or apply our terms and
    conditions; to develop community legal service delivery; or protect the rights, property, or
    safety of LawSpot, our users, or others. Users of the Website can contact us at
    <a href="&#109;ailto&#58;support&#64;lawspot.org.nz">support&#64;lawspot.org.nz</a> to ask
    whether such information has been provided.
</p>

<h2>User registration</h2>

<p>
    Before you can submit a question on LawSpot, we require you to provide us with your email
    address and the region in which you live. We do not ask for your name. We require your email
    address so that we can notify you when your question has been answered. Your email address will
    never be published online or shared with our lawyer volunteers. We need to know which region
    you live in so that we can connect you to community legal services convenient to you. We may
    also use your email address to contact you and send you information about LawSpot and/or some
    of our affiliated partners.
</p>

<h2>Lawyer registration</h2>

<p>
    You must be enrolled as a barrister and solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand and hold a
    current practising certificate in order to sign up to answer questions on LawSpot. As part of
    the lawyer registration process, we require you to provide us with your name, email address,
    the year in which you were admitted to the Bar, and the name of the law firm by which you are
    currently employed. You may also choose to specify the area of law in which you specialise (if
    any).
</p>

<p>
    We require your email address so that we can notify you that your registration has been
    approved once LawSpot has verified that you hold a current practising certificate. Your name,
    firm name and year of admission is required to simplify this verification process. Your
    identity will never be disclosed to users of the Website. Your answer will be supervised by a
    Wellington Community Law Centre (WCLC) supervisor and published under the name of the WCLC.
</p>

<p>
    We will also email you to notify you when there are unanswered questions open for you to
    answer. We may also use your email address to contact you and send you information about
    LawSpot and/or some of our affiliated partners.
</p>

<h2>Updating your account information</h2>

<p>
    We provide you with ways in which you can update your personal account information, including
    changing your email address and password. We store previous email addresses against your
    profile to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions.
</p>

<h2>Email</h2>

<p>
    If you are registered with LawSpot, we may send you emails about LawSpot, in addition to our
    customary question and answer-related communications. Further, it is our policy to remove any
    user from LawSpot’s mailing list upon that user’s request. We use email as a means of receiving
    feedback from the general public, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or
    comments.
</p>

<p>
    We reserve the right to contact you via email to invite you to complete a feedback survey for
    us once you have had a question answered on LawSpot. The survey may ask you for personal and
    demographic information on a confidential basis, to be used to improve the LawSpot service.
    Completing the survey is voluntary. Survey responses will be processed by LawSpot
    administrative staff and not seen by any of LawSpot’s lawyer volunteers, to ensure that the
    user cannot be linked through the identifying information to the particular legal question they
    earlier posted. Data compiled through the survey may be shared by LawSpot with the Ministry of
    Justice for statistical and budgetary purposes.
</p>

<h2>Asking questions on LawSpot</h2>

<p>
    <i>Will my question be anonymous?</i><br />
    Yes, your question will be anonymous. When your question is submitted, your email is removed
    and LawSpot’s administrators will delete any part of your question that contains identifying
    features about you. Be aware that your question may be modified slightly before it is put into
    a pool of questions that our lawyer volunteers may choose to answer. At no point will a public
    user of the Website or a LawSpot lawyer volunteer have access to identifying details about you
    such as your email address. This is to ensure user anonymity and to prevent lawyer volunteers
    from being conflicted out of answering some users’ questions. Only LawSpot administrators will
    be able to view the question directly as submitted by you online. LawSpot may only use
    information that is personal to you for the limited purposes outlined above, in the “Use of
    your information” section of this policy.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Will my question be published online?</i><br />
    Yes, your question will be published online. When you submit a question on the Website, you
    will be asked to tick a box that asks if you agree to the Website’s <a href="/terms">Terms of
    Use</a>. By ticking this box, you understand that your question and the answer will be
    published on the Website for public view. We make this content available as it may be helpful
    to other users. (But as the <a href="/important-notice">Important Notice</a> appended to each
    answer makes clear, you should not rely on a generic answer provided on the Website even if
    you are in a similar situation, as small variations in fact can change a legal outcome or a
    lawyer’s conclusion.) Accordingly, you waive your right to claim confidentiality over the
    content of your question and the answer provided. No liability whatsoever is accepted by the
    authors or the publishers, for loss, damage or inconvenience consequent upon the question and
    answer being made public once you have indicated that you agree to share your answer with other
    users of the Website.
</p>

<h2>Answering questions on LawSpot</h2>

<p>
    When you register to answer questions on LawSpot, you will be asked to tick a box that asks if
    you agree to <a href="/lawyer-policy">LawSpot’s Policy for Lawyer Volunteers</a>. By
    ticking this box, you understand that your answer will be published online under the name of
    the WCLC, and that supervisors from the WCLC reserve the right to modify or rewrite your answer
    before it is published online. Accordingly, you waive any rights to claim confidentiality over
    the content of the answer you submit. The <a href="/important-notice">Important Notice</a>
    attached to every answer makes clear that no liability whatsoever is accepted by the authors or
    the publishers, for loss, damage or inconvenience consequent upon the question or answer being
    made public. Your identity will not be linked to the answer or shared with the public.
</p>

<h2>Control of your password</h2>

<p>
    You are responsible for all actions taken with your LawSpot account, email address and
    password. Therefore, we do not recommend that you disclose your LawSpot password to any third
    parties. If you choose to share your user name, email address and password or your information
    with third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all actions
    taken with this information and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
    It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your
    computer. Ensure you logout when you have finished visiting the Website, especially if you
    access the Website from a shared computer.

    We use "session" cookies to temporarily store information to help you use the Website. This
    information is used to deliver the right content to you as you use the Website and avoids
    unnecessarily asking you to log in. Session cookies expire immediately when you close your web

<p>
    We also use "persistent" cookies to personalise the user experience, to help protect our
    members and to provide us with research information (such as how often users visit LawSpot each
    month). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on LawSpot and help us identify users
    abusing the LawSpot service. A persistent auto-login cookie is also stored when LawSpot users
    select the "remember me" option when logging in. The auto-login cookie is removed when the
    LawSpot user logs out.

    AdWords advertisements appear on Google's search result pages and on the Google Network. Google
    can use cookies to measure the number of Google users that visit certain LawSpot web pages, or
    who complete certain actions on the Website. Google is able to provide this data to LawSpot
    without identifying the users. View <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google's

<h2>Third party links</h2>

<p>
    The LawSpot website may contain links to third party sites to enhance the user experience. We
    have no control of either the content or privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links
    be considered an endorsement of these sites except where otherwise noted. In some cases, third
    party advertisers may also use cookies in certain advertisements or links that appear on the
    Website for advertising purposes.
</p>

<h2>Other information we collect</h2>

<p>
    We use additional information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests,
    and behaviour to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may
    include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you
    next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP
    address.
</p>

<p>
    Users who login may have their IP addresses recorded. This information will only be provided to
    legal authorities in cases of suspected fraud or for law enforcement purposes. This information
    is stored securely and will not be provided to other members or non-authorised parties.
</p>

<p>
    If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails, or if members of the LawSpot
    administrative staff send us correspondence about your activities on the Website, we may
    collect such information into a file specific to you.
</p>

<h2>Removal of registration</h2>

<p>
    If you wish to have your registration removed from our directory for any reason, you may send
    us an email requesting this.
</p>

    From time to time, we make changes to our information practices or alter the functionality of
    our Website. We always update this statement accordingly, so we encourage you to periodically
