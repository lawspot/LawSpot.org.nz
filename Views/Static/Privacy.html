<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
    Protecting your privacy matters to us. This document discloses our information gathering and
    usage practices in relation to the LawSpot website (the Website). For additional information
    about the Website please review our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>. We reserve the right to
    change our privacy policy from time to time but will notify our users about any such changes on
    the Website.
</p>

<h2>Use of your information</h2>

<p>We will only use personal information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>to help us provide LawSpot services to you;
<li>to verify your identity;
<li>to enforce or apply our terms and conditions;
<li>to protect the rights, property, or safety of LawSpot, our users, or others;
<li>if the law requires us to;
<li>for statistical and budgetary research purposes; and
<li>for any other use that you authorise.
</ul>

<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. Users of the Website can contact us at support@lawspot.org.nz to ask about their personal information.</p>

<h2>User registration</h2>

<p>
    Before you can submit a question on LawSpot, we require your email address so that we can
    notify you when your question has been answered. This will never be published online or shared
    with our lawyer volunteers - your identity will be protected at all times.  We also need to
    know which region you live in so that we can connect you to community legal services convenient
    to you.
</p>

<h2>Lawyer registration</h2>

<p>
    As part of the lawyer registration process, we require lawyers to provide us with their name and
    work email address so that we can verify that they hold a current practising certificate. The
    identity of lawyer volunteers will not be disclosed to the public.  The answers of volunteers are
    published under the name of the partner law firm, lawyer or community law centre who supervises
    the answer.
</p>

<h2>Updating your account information</h2>

<p>
    We provide you with ways to update your personal account information, including
    changing your email address and password. We store previous email addresses against your
    profile to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions.
</p>

<h2>Email</h2>

<p>
    If you are registered with LawSpot, we may send you emails about LawSpot, in addition to our
    customary question and answer-related communications. We will remove you from our mailing list
    at your request.
</p>

<p>
    We may also email you to invite you to complete a feedback survey for
    us once you have had a question answered on LawSpot. The survey may ask you for personal and
    demographic information on a confidential basis, to be used to improve the LawSpot service.
    Survey responses will be processed by LawSpot administrative staff and individual responses
    will not be seen by any of LawSpot’s lawyer volunteers. Data compiled through
    the survey may be shared by LawSpot with the Ministry of Justice for statistical and budgetary
    purposes.
</p>

<h2>Asking questions on LawSpot</h2>

<p>
    <i>Will my question be anonymous?</i><br />
    Yes, your question will be anonymous. When your question is submitted, your email is removed
    and LawSpot’s administrators will delete any part of your question that contains identifying
    features about you. At no point will a public
    user of the Website or a LawSpot lawyer volunteer have access to identifying details about you
    such as your email address. Only LawSpot administrators will be able to view the question
    directly as submitted by you online and any personal information about you may only be used by
    LawSpot for the limited purposes outlined above, in the “Use of your information” section of
    this policy.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Will my question be published online?</i><br />
    Yes, your question will be published online. When you submit a question on the Website, you
    will be asked to tick a box that asks if you agree to the Website’s <a href="/terms">Terms of
    Use</a>. By ticking this box, you understand that your question and the answer will be
    published on the Website for public view. Accordingly, you waive your right to claim
    confidentiality over the content of your question and the answer provided. No liability
    whatsoever is accepted by the authors or the publishers, for loss, damage or inconvenience
    consequent upon the question and answer being made public.
</p>

<h2>Control of your password</h2>

<p>
    You are responsible for all actions taken with your LawSpot account, email address and
    password.
</p>

<p>
    It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your
    computer. Ensure you logout when you have finished visiting the Website, especially if you
    access the Website from a shared computer.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>
    Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser in a file on your
    computer's hard drive when you use our Website. We use cookies to improve the experience of
    using our site. Cookies are widely used on most major websites.
</p>

<p>
    We use "session" cookies to temporarily store information to help you use the Website. This
    information is used to deliver the right content to you as you use the Website and avoids
    unnecessarily asking you to log in. Session cookies expire immediately when you close your web
    browser.
</p>
<p>
    We also use "persistent" cookies to personalise the user experience, to help protect our
    members and to provide us with research information (such as how often users visit LawSpot each
    month). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on LawSpot and help us identify users
    abusing the LawSpot service. A persistent auto-login cookie is also stored when LawSpot users
    select the "remember me" option when logging in. The auto-login cookie is removed when the
    LawSpot user logs out.
</p>

<h2>Third party links</h2>

<p>
    The LawSpot website may contain links to third party sites to enhance the user experience. We
    have no control of either the content or privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links
    be considered an endorsement of these sites except where otherwise noted. In some cases, third
    party advertisers may also use cookies in certain advertisements or links that appear on the
    Website for advertising purposes.
</p>

<h2>Other information we collect</h2>

<p>
    We use additional information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests,
    and behaviour to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may
    include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you
    next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP
    address.
</p>

<p>
    Users who login may have their IP addresses recorded. LawSpot will only use this for the
    limited purposes outlined above, in the “Use of your information” section of this policy.
</p>

<p>
    If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails, or if members of the LawSpot
    administrative staff send us correspondence about your activities on the Website, we may
    collect such information into a file specific to you.
</p>

<h2>Removal of registration</h2>

<p>
    If you wish to have your registration removed from our directory for any reason, you may send
    us an email requesting this.
</p>

<h2>Updates to our information practices</h2>

<p>
    From time to time, we make changes to our information practices or alter the functionality of
    our Website. We always update this statement accordingly, so we encourage you to periodically
    review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
