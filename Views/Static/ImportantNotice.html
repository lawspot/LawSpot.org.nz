    The answer provided above is intended for general informational purposes only and cannot be
    considered a substitute for face-to-face legal advice. It should not be relied upon as the sole
    basis for taking action in relation to a legal issue. Laws change frequently, and small
    variations in the facts, or a fact not provided in the question, can often change a legal
    outcome or a lawyer’s conclusion. No liability whatsoever is accepted by the authors or
    publishers of the answer, for loss, damage or inconvenience arising in any way from the use of
    this site. While each answer has been published by a lawyer with a practising certificate, that
    person may not necessarily have experience in the particular area of law involved.
