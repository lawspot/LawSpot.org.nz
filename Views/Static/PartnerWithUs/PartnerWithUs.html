<h2>Community Law</h2>

<p>LawSpot operates in partnership with <a href="http://www.wclc.org.nz/" target="_blank">Community Law Wellington and Hutt Valley</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the answers published refer to chapters in the Legal Reference Manual accessible from the website of the Coalition of Community Law Centres o Aotearoa. This is a great resource covering many areas of law that people have questions about - check it out at:</p>
