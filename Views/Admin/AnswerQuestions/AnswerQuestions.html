                    will appear as part of your answer to make clear to the user the limitations
                    to the answer provided and to draw to their attention the fact that no liability
                    whatsoever is accepted by the authors or publishers of the answer, for loss,

                IMPORTANT NOTICE: The answer provided above is intended for general informational
                purposes only and cannot be considered a substitute for personal legal advice
                specific to your particular circumstances. Laws change frequently, and small
                variations in the facts, or a fact not provided in the question, can often change
                a legal outcome or a lawyer’s conclusion. No liability whatsoever is accepted by
                the authors or publishers of the answer, for loss, damage or inconvenience arising
                in any way from the use of this site. The Wellington Community Law Centre provides
                legal supervision of the answers submitted by LawSpot’s lawyer volunteers and may
                alter or rewrite the answers received from these volunteers before an answer is
                published online. Thus multiple lawyers may have contributed to the answer above,
                and no solicitor-client relationship is entered into by any of the lawyers involved
                in answering this question. Although LawSpot has verified that the lawyer providing
                the answer is enrolled as a barrister and solicitor of the High Court of New
                Zealand and holds a current practising certificate, he or she may not necessarily
                have experience in the area of law involved. Unlike the information provided in the
                answer above, should you seek personal legal advice specific to your particular
                circumstances you should go to a Community Law Centre or retain a lawyer to
                represent you. This answer may contain links to other web sites. These links are
