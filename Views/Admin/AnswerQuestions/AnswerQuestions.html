                Your answer will be screened by a legally qualified Wellington Community Law
                Centre (WCLC) supervisor before it is published online. The supervisor may modify
                or rewrite your answer, or reject it outright. When approved, the answer will be
                published under the name of the WCLC, not under your own name. In addition, this
                <a href="#" class="important-notice-link">Important Notice</a> will appear as part
                of your answer, to make clear to the user the answer’s limitations.

            IMPORTANT NOTICE: The answer provided above is intended for general informational
            purposes only and cannot be considered a substitute for personal legal advice
            specific to your particular circumstances. Laws change frequently, and small
            variations in the facts, or a fact not provided in the question, can often change
            a legal outcome or a lawyer’s conclusion. No liability whatsoever is accepted by
            the authors or publishers of the answer, for loss, damage or inconvenience arising
            in any way from the use of this site. The Wellington Community Law Centre provides
            legal supervision of the answers submitted by LawSpot’s lawyer volunteers and may
            alter or rewrite the answers received from these volunteers before an answer is
            published online. Thus multiple lawyers may have contributed to the answer above,
            and no solicitor-client relationship is entered into by any of the lawyers involved
            in answering this question. Although LawSpot has verified that the lawyer providing
            the answer is enrolled as a barrister and solicitor of the High Court of New
            Zealand and holds a current practising certificate, he or she may not necessarily
            have experience in the area of law involved. Unlike the information provided in the
            answer above, should you seek personal legal advice specific to your particular
            circumstances you should go to a Community Law Centre or retain a lawyer to
            represent you. This answer may contain links to other web sites. These links are
