    Please note that LawSpot is currently being piloted in the Wellington region. This means that
    for the moment only lawyers based in Wellington will be able to submit answers to questions,
    and only under the supervision of Community Law Wellington & Hutt Valley. We’d still love to hear 
    from anyone interested in being involved, so if you're interested, please email us at
    <a href="&#109;ailto&#58;volunteer&#64;lawspot.org.nz">volunteer&#64;lawspot.org.nz</a>.
