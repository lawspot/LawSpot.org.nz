        The answer provided above is intended for general informational
        purposes only and cannot be considered a substitute for personal legal advice
        specific to your particular circumstances. Laws change frequently, and small
        variations in the facts, or a fact not provided in the question, can often change
        a legal outcome or a lawyer’s conclusion. No liability whatsoever is accepted by
        the authors or publishers of the answer, for loss, damage or inconvenience arising
        in any way from the use of this site. The Wellington Community Law Centre provides
        legal supervision of the answers submitted by LawSpot’s lawyer volunteers and may
        alter or rewrite the answers received from these volunteers before an answer is
        published online. Thus multiple lawyers may have contributed to the answer above,
        and no solicitor-client relationship is entered into by any of the lawyers involved
        in answering this question. Although LawSpot has verified that the lawyer providing
        the answer is enrolled as a barrister and solicitor of the High Court of New
        Zealand and holds a current practising certificate, he or she may not necessarily
        have experience in the area of law involved. Unlike the information provided in the
        answer above, should you seek personal legal advice specific to your particular
        circumstances you should go to a Community Law Centre or retain a lawyer to
        represent you. This answer may contain links to other web sites. These links are
