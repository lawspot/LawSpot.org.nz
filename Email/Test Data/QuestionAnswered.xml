    You will need to do a lot of reading and possibly get some legal advice.<br/>
    <br/>
    To be a charity, you need to register with the Charities Commission. There are charitable
    requirements you will need to meet. You will also need to consider the options for what sort of
    structure you want to establish. There is a lot for you to consider, but there is also a lot of
    helpful informatin on the Charities Commission website:

    <br/>
    Click that link and have a really good read, and then consider whether it might be worth getting a
    bit of legal help. It is not compulsory to use a lawyer but it can be very helpful. You might ask
    your community law centre for local advice options: <a href="http://www.communitylaw.org.nz">www.communitylaw.org.nz</a>
